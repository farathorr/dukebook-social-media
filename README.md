# React Social Media App
This application is a mashup of Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, with our own improvements on top. The application can be used to connect with friends and share your thoughts or images.


The target audience of this application is everyone with access to the internet. The project has no stakeholders (yet) as it is a school project. 


The backend server is deployed using Render, the frontend server is deployed using Vercel.
